Scientist in Physical Sciences and Canada Research Chair – Tier 2 in Artificial Intelligence Applied to Medical Imaging and Image-Guided Therapy (one position)

The Sunnybrook Research Institute (SRI) is seeking candidates for a Scientist position in the Physical Sciences in Artificial Intelligence applied to medical imaging and image-guided therapy. The selected candidate will become member of the Physical Sciences Platform of SRI and may be nominated for a Tier 2 Canada Research Chair.

Position: AI applied to medical imaging and image-guided therapy

We are seeking a researcher focused on developing new machine learning methodologies for medical image data in a clinical environment. Examples of research areas of interest include, but are not restricted to: integration of imaging, molecular and clinical data to create prognostic models; development of fast image reconstruction or registration algorithms using deep learning; triaging of patients using AI-assisted image analysis; domain adaptation methods; safety and interpretability of AI for medical applications.

The applicant must show strong evidence of research and scholarly achievement, and a proven capacity in mentoring and collaboration. The successful applicant will develop an internationally competitive research program and participate in graduate training through an academic appointment in the appropriate department at the University of Toronto (e.g. the Department of Medical Biophysics, or the Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering). In addition to fostering local, national, and international collaborations, the successful applicant will be expected to collaborate with SRI Scientists, build complementary translational research capacity, and engage with Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre Clinicians so as to enable short- and/or long-term clinical translation of their research, ultimately contributing to Sunnybrook’s strategic direction in Personalized and Precise Treatments, with a vision of inventing the future of healthcare. SRI has an outstanding capacity for the development of translational research programs across a range of clinical foci. The applicants research program is thus expected to align well with one or more of the nine clinical programs described below. There are also extensive opportunities for collaborations within Toronto, which is a globally recognized hub for AI and biomedical research. SRI faculty have links to the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and to the recently established Centre for AI Research and Education in Medicine, University of Toronto. The Greater Toronto Area is home to the highest concentration of AI startup companies in the world, providing many opportunities for SRI Scientists to work with industrial partners.

About Sunnybrook Research Institute: SRI is a research organization owned by Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, one of Canada’s leading academic health sciences centres. SRI is fully affiliated with the University of Toronto and comprises three research platforms: Biological Sciences, Evaluative Clinical Sciences and Physical Sciences, each of which functions similarly to a university department under the leadership of a cognate director. The institute supports $100 million of annual research activities within approximately 250,000 square feet of state-of-the-art research space located at the Bayview campus of Sunnybrook. SRI has one of the best recognized and most productive research teams in the field of medical imaging and physical sciences in the world. The Physical Sciences Platform is comprised of 64 scientists and has a total staff of over 300, including close to 100 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows associated with the University of Toronto.

SRI infrastructure is housed within 250,000 square feet of research space that includes one 1.5T (GE) and three 3T (GE, Philips, Siemens) research-dedicated MRI systems, a research MRI-PET system (Siemens), a system for MRI-guided focused ultrasound brain treatments (Insightec), a combined X-ray / MRI suite dedicated to research on image-guided interventions, a research CT system (Canon/Toshiba), a 7T small-bore MRI system (Bruker), a vertical 7T NMR system (Bruker), a twin multiphon laser scanning microscope (Olympus), a GE Spinlab polarizer for 13C MRI research, a wide range of ultrasound machines as well as preclinical photoacoustic systems. This extensive imaging infrastructure is supplemented by a Device Development Lab (DDL; RF electronics and advanced machine shops), a cyclotron, flow cytometry facilities, a whole-mount 3D histopathology laboratory and GMP-grade clean rooms for drug and contrast agent development.

The goal of the Physical Science Platform is to advance scientific discovery, develop new medical technologies, and foster commercialization of discovery research so as to enable its translation and uptake into the clinic. Our research is specifically aimed at the delivery of novel diagnostic and interventional techniques to the hospital’s nine clinical programs:
Holland Bone and Joint with primary foci in the areas of traumatic fracture treatment, the impact of arthritis management, and minimally invasive interventional strategies for spinal metastases;
Hurvitz Brain Sciences with major foci in stroke and neurodegenerative diseases (like dementias and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), mood and anxiety disorders, neuropsychiatric consequences of traumatic brain injury, and sleep disorders;
Integrated Community that includes emergency imaging across the programs (such as trauma and cancer), has research foci in outpatient COPD, infectious diseases, and dialysis patients, and is evaluating the linkages between hospital-based resources and community healthcare providers;
Odette Cancer with Canada’s largest academic programs in breast cancer and radiation oncology, and a central nervous system program with MR-Linac and GammaKnife Technologies;
Schulich Heart with one of Canada’s largest transcutaneous structural/valve programs and its research - focused on image guided therapies for structural disease, coronary disease and complex arrhythmias - extending from device development and preclinical study to integrated care pathways creation and novel health policy;
John’s Rehab with the only organ transplant program in Canada and the sole burn and oncology programs in Ontario in addition to major programs in limb loss, MSK, cardiac, and stroke;
Tory Trauma that is the largest trauma program in Canada, with a third of the patients with traumatic brain injury and the largest burn centre in Canada;
Veterans with the largest veterans care facility in Canada; and
DAN Women and Babies Program that is home to a very high volume high risk pregnancy unit and is doing globally leading work in twin pregnancy and interventions to improve outcome of babies born preterm, as well as exploring the frontiers of in utero fetal brain imaging.
Research areas in Physical Sciences include Biomedical Imaging and Image Analysis (MRI, Ultrasound, X-Ray, Digital Pathology and Optical); Precision Medicine (Radiogenomics, Theranostics); Computational Modeling and Machine Learning; Design and Development of Medical Devices; Biophysics and Bioengineering. A major focus is Image-Guided Therapy, a theme that has been supported by the Canada Foundation for Innovation leading to the establishment of the Centre for Research in Image-Guided Therapeutics; by the FedDev program resulting in Image-Guided Therapy cluster; and by the federal Strategic Innovation Fund giving rise to Inovait, an industry-academic consortium for AI and Image-Guided Therapy. Physical Scientists at SRI engage clinical partners in their research and pursue opportunities to move their innovations to the clinic through pre-clinical and first-in-human testing to commercialize the products of their research by creating start-ups and licensing, and/or by partnering with companies in the development of new technologies. They are strongly supported in these efforts by SRI’s Technology Transfer office.
