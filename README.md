# ds_salary_proj
## PURPOSE
The idea is to create a data science project from scratch. It will comprise of the following stages:
## DATA SCIENCE PROJECT

### Project Planning
Analyze salaries of **Data Scientists** across NORTH AMERICA using glassdoor data. 

### Data Acquisition
A little twist. Instead of acquiring 1000 job data from the USA, I did 500 from the USA and 500 from Canada as Canada is my home country :)

#### Take Aways
There are a few steps to be careful of.
##### CHROME DRIVER
-	Chrome webdriver version. Make sure it is compatible with your system. 

-	In the code, change the driver path for your system.
