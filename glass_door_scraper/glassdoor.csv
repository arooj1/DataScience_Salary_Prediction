ABOUT

We believe every human on the planet should have the option of free access to the world’s information and content. In many cases this belief is powered by a three way value exchange between a publisher producing free content, a consumer consuming it and an advertiser paying the publisher for the chance to connect with its audience. The underpinning of this value exchange relies on having an independent auditing, measurement and optimization layer to power the transaction between the advertiser and publisher.

Today the industry standard tools for advertising and media measurement and optimization are usually designed where increased personalization, higher advertising return on investment and increased publisher revenues often comes with negative trade off for consumer privacy or security risks of leaking private data. We envision a world where this doesn't have to be the case - a world where consumer privacy, security, and governance are incorporated into the fabric of the codebase while enabling the necessary business use-cases to effectively keep the world’s information and content free for everyone.

VideoAmp’s mission is to create software and data solutions to enable advertisers to accurately measure and optimize their entire portfolio of linear TV, OTT, digital and walled garden investments while empowering publishers to effectively align and monetize their audiences with the advertiser’s desired outcome in a consumer-first privacy paradigm.

ABOUT

We believe every human on the planet should have the option of free access to the world’s information and content. In many cases this belief is powered by a three way value exchange between a publisher producing free content, a consumer consuming it and an advertiser paying the publisher for the chance to connect with its audience. The underpinning of this value exchange relies on having an independent auditing, measurement and optimization layer to power the transaction between the advertiser and publisher.

Today the industry standard tools for advertising and media measurement and optimization are usually designed where increased personalization, higher advertising return on investment and increased publisher revenues often comes with negative trade off for consumer privacy or security risks of leaking private data. We envision a world where this doesn't have to be the case - a world where consumer privacy, security, and governance are incorporated into the fabric of the codebase while enabling the necessary business use-cases to effectively keep the world’s information and content free for everyone.

VideoAmp’s mission is to create software and data solutions to enable advertisers to accurately measure and optimize their entire portfolio of linear TV, OTT, digital and walled garden investments while empowering publishers to effectively align and monetize their audiences with the advertiser’s desired outcome in a consumer-first privacy paradigm.

This individual will serve in a critical leadership role of a premier scientific organization whose investigators and staff are recognized as world leaders in immunology, virology, structural biology, pathogenesis, laboratory animal medicine, regulatory science, clinical research, bio-engineering, and vaccinology. The incumbent advises the VRC Director and provides expertise in planning, formulating, and implementing new and existing VRC scientific programs, setting priorities, and forecasting and meeting VRC’s programmatic needs. The incumbent will also serve as principal advisor to the Scientific Director of NIAID on trans-NIAID, trans-NIH, departmental, and government-wide issues concerning science policy, management policy, or program management and would serve on various NIAID and NIH scientific advisory committees.

To realize the public health potential of these new products, the VRC works closely with partners in government, academia, and industry to transition new vaccines and biologics into commercial use. VRC scientists and staff are often the vanguard of NIH public health responses, as demonstrated by their key role in developing several candidate vaccines, biologics, and immunoassays currently being tested or in use during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The incumbent will play a key role in effectively and efficiently harnessing the capabilities of the VRC by carrying out a broad range of operational and management responsibilities, including scientific management and operational aspects of basic, preclinical, and clinical research, vaccine production programs, technology transfer and licensing, program planning and evaluation, quality systems, ensuring regulatory compliance, policy analysis, legislation, information systems technology support, internal and external communications, scientific and administrative reports, human resource matters (including acquisition, retention, and thoughtful management of staff resources), facility management, capacity building, coordinating contract acquisition and oversight, fiscal planning, and budgetary/financial and administrative management.
